emotional.pl
============

Like unicode emotes, but hate copying and pasting? Emotional lets you express your feelings using simple, web-forum-style shortcuts. Next time you're so frustrated you could (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻, just type `:flip:`, and emotional will take care of the rest.

What emotes are included?
-------------------------

Straight from the source:

* `:check:`   → `☑`
* `:dongers:` → `ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ`
* `:flip:`    → `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`
* `:flower:`  → '(✿◠‿◠)',
* `:give:`    → `༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ`
* `:guns:`    → `(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞`,
* `:lenny:`   → `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`
* `:look:`    → `ಠ_ಠ`
* `:nocheck:` → `☐`
* `:notes:`   → `♫`
* `:shades:`  → `(-■_■)`
* `:shrug:`   → `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
* `:tears:`   → `ಥ_ಥ`
* `:unflip:`  → `┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)`

Not a very big set to start with, but it's easy to add your own.

Ok, how do I add my own emotes?
-------------------------------

Simple! Just add another line to the `%emotes` hash near the top of the script, with the desired shortcut on the left and the final appearance on the right. Use the starting emotes as examples.
